# Day One Cloud Website Walkthrough

I have successfully created the corporate website for **Day One Cloud**. The site is designed to be modern, impressive, and reflective of a smart AI agency.

## Features

- **Modern Aesthetic**: Dark slate background with glowing cyan and amber accents, matching the "Day One" brand.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Smooth Animations**: Scroll-triggered fade-in and slide-up animations for a dynamic feel.
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects on buttons and service cards.
- **Single Page Navigation**: Smooth scrolling to different sections (Services, About, Contact).

## Sections

1.  **Hero**: High-impact opening with a gradient text headline and animated background glows.
2.  **Services**: Grid layout showcasing key offerings (Strategic Consulting, Custom Models, Cloud Infrastructure).
3.  **About**: Company mission statement with an abstract animated visual.
4.  **Contact**: Clean contact form to capture leads.
